## ◼️ Can I introduce myself? 
Hello, everyone! My name is Yauhen. I'm from Minsk. I graduated from Sukhoi State Technical University of Gomel. Speciality: Power Engineering. I work as a senior engineer of the project in a construction company. My main responsibility is to create automatic process control systems and emergency protection of technological processes. I was always interested in programming and now I would like to change my occupation. That's why I joined the online course for front-end developers "RS School".
